This notebook implements a basic chatbot using Python and integrates OpenAI's GPT model for generating dynamic responses. It also uses a traditional rule-based system with an intents.json file for structured intent recognition. The code includes natural language processing (NLP) techniques like tokenization and lemmatization, and trains a simple neural network to classify user input. Depending on the context, the chatbot can respond using predefined answers or generate replies using OpenAI's API.
